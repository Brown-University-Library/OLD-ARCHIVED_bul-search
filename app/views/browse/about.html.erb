<h1>About StackLife</h1>
<p>The StackLife page is an attempt to give our users the ability to
  browse the stacks in a similar way to what people do when
  they walk around the shelves at the library.</p>

<p> For example, let's say that you are looking at the book "Splendours of Morocco"
  by Izza Genini and you want to see what other books would be next to it
  if you were standing in front of it at the library.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <%= image_tag("browse_about.png", style: "border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;") %>
  <br/>
  &nbsp;<br/>
</p>

<p>Notice the links <b>More Like This</b> and <b>Browse the Stacks</b> on the
  Tools section of the page.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Browse the Stacks</b> will take you to a new page with the books that
  are on the shelf next to "Splendours of Morocco".
  <%= link_to("Try it out!", browse_item_path(id: "b3130393")) %>
  <li><b>More Like This</b> provides similar functionality but in a smaller
  display. Instead of opening a new page, this link will display a small
  stack of books at the bottom of the page.
  <%= link_to("Try it out!", catalog_path(id: "b3130393", nearby: "y")) %>
</ul>

<p>Depending on what kind of search you are doing you might enjoy a full page
  with the stack or the smaller version. They both provide the same information.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>TODO: document here that not all the items in the library have call numbers
  and therefore only about 50% of our items are available on the StackLife
  pages.</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>The StackLife page is based on a plug-in developed by the Harvard Innovation
  Lab. You can see the plug-in source code on this
  <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/stacklife">GitHub</a>
  repo.</p>
