      Welcome to the new search tool for discovering materials in the Brown University Libraryâ€™s collections. You will find books, articles, materials in all other formats, and even Library web pages, through a simple search box. The discovery service also allows you to filter and refine your search results based on your needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The design and functionality of the discovery service is based on the Library's ongoing evaluation of services, and specifically based on a review of user and staff feedback over a two year period. As we continue to work on an improved search experience for all, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VFbkZQR_1EIqsZ8RgLv1mo_0nnKtIT6AIe-Ms_SY_1E/viewform">we welcome your questions and comments</a>.
