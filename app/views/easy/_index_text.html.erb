      easySearch <sup>beta</sup> is the search tool for discovering materials in the Brown University Libraryâ€™s collections. It includes books, articles, all other formats, and the Library web site through a simple search box, allowing you to filter your search results based on your needs.

      During the Spring 2015, the Library is testing a new tool to help you navigate through the millions of items held by the Library and improve your search experience. The design and functionality of easySearch <sup>beta</sup> is based on the Library's ongoing evaluation of services and specifically based on a review of user and staff feedback over a two year period.

      As we continue to work on an improved search experience for all, we welcome your questions and comments.
