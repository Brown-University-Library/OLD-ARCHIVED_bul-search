# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
# one: {}
# # column: value
# #
# two: {}
# #  column: value


# prevents tests from failing with error `column email is not unique: INSERT INTO "users" (...`
# from <http://stackoverflow.com/a/5780845>

one:
  email: test1@test.com

two:
  email: test2@test.com
